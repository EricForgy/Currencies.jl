One thing that helps in some circumstances is being able to specify the rounding method, or being able to do the calculations yourself. This package provides only the most useful rounding method, which is Julia's built-in \nround\n. To do a different rounding method, you must perform the calculations yourself, on a real type of your choice, by temporarily \"taking apart\" the data, and converting it back when it needs to be rounded (note that here, you're in charge of how to round the data). For example:\n\n\n@usingcurrencies\n \nUSD\n\n\nmoney\n \n=\n \n1\nUSD\n                     \n# 1 USD\n\n\nmagn\n \n=\n \nmoney\n.\nval\n                 \n# 1.00\n\n\nsymb\n \n=\n \ncurrency\n(\nmoney\n)\n           \n# :USD\n\n\na\n \n=\n \n\u03c0\n^\n2\n \n*\n \nmagn\n                   \n# 9.86960440...\n\n\nMonetary\n(\nsymb\n,\n \nround\n(\nInt\n,\n \n100\na\n))\n \n# 9.87 USD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nThe \n.val\n field access is expected to be deprecated in the future.

The currency used is part of the type and not the object. The value is internally represented as a quantity of some integer type. The usual way to construct a \nMonetary\n directly, if needed, is:\n\n\nMonetary(:USD)      # 1.00 USD\nMonetary(:USD, 325) # 3.25 USD\n\n\n\n\n\nBe careful about the decimal point, as the \nMonetary\n constructor takes an integer, representing the number of smallest denominations of the currency. Typically, this constructor is not called directly. It is easier to use the \n@usingcurrencies\n macro and the \n100USD\n form instead.\n\n\nAlthough this type is flexible enough to support values internally represented as any integer type, such as \nBigInt\n, it is recommended to use the built-in \nInt\n type on your architecture unless you need a bigger type. Do not mix different kinds of internal types. To use a different internal representation, change the type of the second argument to \nMonetary\n:\n\n\nMonetary(:USD, BigInt(100))\n\n\n\n\n\nIn some applications, the minor denomination of a currency is not precise enough. It is sometimes useful to override the number of decimal points stored. For these applications, a third type parameter can be provided, indicating the number of decimal points to keep after the major denomination:\n\n\nMonetary{:USD, BigInt, 4}(10000)            # 1.0000 USD\nMonetary(:USD, BigInt(10000); precision=4)  # 1.0000 USD\n\n\n\n\n\nsource\n\n\n#\n\n\nCurrencies.CurrenciesBase.AbstractMonetary\n \n \nType\n.\n\n\nThe abstract type of objects representing a single value in one currency, or a collection of values in a set of currencies.

            "text": "#  Currencies.CurrenciesBase.Monetary     Type .  A representation of a monetary value, denominated in some currency. The currency used is part of the type and not the object. The value is internally represented as a quantity of some integer type. The usual way to construct a  Monetary  directly, if needed, is:  Monetary(:USD)      # 1.00 USD\nMonetary(:USD, 325) # 3.25 USD  Be careful about the decimal point, as the  Monetary  constructor takes an integer, representing the number of smallest denominations of the currency. Typically, this constructor is not called directly. It is easier to use the  @usingcurrencies  macro and the  100USD  form instead.  Although this type is flexible enough to support values internally represented as any integer type, such as  BigInt , it is recommended to use the built-in  Int  type on your architecture unless you need a bigger type. Do not mix different kinds of internal types. To use a different internal representation, change the type of the second argument to  Monetary :  Monetary(:USD, BigInt(100))  In some applications, the minor denomination of a currency is not precise enough. It is sometimes useful to override the number of decimal points stored. For these applications, a third type parameter can be provided, indicating the number of decimal points to keep after the major denomination:  Monetary{:USD, BigInt, 4}(10000)            # 1.0000 USD\nMonetary(:USD, BigInt(10000); precision=4)  # 1.0000 USD  source  #  Currencies.CurrenciesBase.AbstractMonetary     Type .  The abstract type of objects representing a single value in one currency, or a collection of values in a set of currencies. These objects should behave like  Monetary  or  Basket  objects.  source  #  Currencies.CurrenciesBase.currency     Method .  currency(m::Monetary) \u2192 Symbol  Return a symbol corresponding to the ISO 4217 currency code of the currency that the given monetary amount is representing. For example,  currency(80USD)  will return  :USD . If the given monetary value is of a non-ISO 4217 currency, then the returned symbol should contain only lowercase letters.  Prefer  iso4217alpha  to this function if a string is desired.  source  #  Currencies.CurrenciesBase.currencyinfo     Function .  Get a brief human-readable English-language description of the currency. The description should begin with the common name of the currency, which should describe it unambiguously (up to variations on the same currency). Optionally, parentheses following the main description may include additional information (such as the unit of a major currency unit).  This function may be called with either a symbol, a  Monetary  type, or a  Monetary  object.  source  #  Currencies.CurrenciesBase.decimals     Method .  decimals(m::Monetary) \u2192 Int\ndecimals(s::Symbol)   \u2192 Int\ndecimals(d::DataType) \u2192 Int  Get the precision, in terms of the number of decimal places after the major currency unit, of the given  Monetary  value or type. Alternatively, if given a symbol, gets the default exponent (the number of decimal places to represent the minor currency unit) for that symbol. Return  -1  if there is no sane minor unit, such as for several kinds of precious metal.  source  #  Currencies.CurrenciesBase.iso4217alpha     Function .  iso4217alpha(s::Symbol)   \u2192 String\niso4217alpha(m::Monetary) \u2192 String\niso4217alpha(t::DataType) \u2192 String  Get the ISO 4217 alphabetic code for a currency. For custom currencies, a lowercase string will be returned, and this should not be interpreted as an ISO 4217 code. Otherwise, a three-letter uppercase string will be returned. This function may be called with either a symbol, a  Monetary  type, or a  Monetary  object.  source  #  Currencies.CurrenciesBase.iso4217num     Function .  iso4217num(s::Symbol)   \u2192 Int\niso4217num(m::Monetary) \u2192 Int\niso4217num(t::DataType) \u2192 Int  Get the ISO 4217 numeric code for a currency. For custom currencies, a value of  0  will be returned. This function may be called with either a symbol, a  Monetary  type, or a  Monetary  object. Note that most applications should zero-pad this code to three digits.  source  #  Currencies.CurrenciesBase.longsymbol     Function .  longsymbol(s::Symbol)   \u2192 String\nlongsymbol(m::Monetary) \u2192 String\nlongsymbol(t::DataType) \u2192 String  Get a commonly-used currency symbol for a currency, with at least enough disambiguation to be non-ambiguous. This function may be called with either a symbol, a  Monetary  type, or a  Monetary  object.  source  #  Currencies.CurrenciesBase.majorunit     Function .  majorunit(s::Symbol)   \u2192 Monetary{s}\nmajorunit(m::Monetary) \u2192 typeof(m)\nmajorunit(t::DataType) \u2192 t  Get the major unit of the currency. This function may be called with either a symbol, a  Monetary  type, or a  Monetary  object.  source  #  Currencies.CurrenciesBase.newcurrency!     Method .  Add a new currency to the (global) currency list and return a unit for that currency. Prefer the  @usingcustomcurrency  macro, which leads to more clear code, whenever possible. This function takes three arguments: the symbol for the currency, a string description of the currency (following the conventions outlined in the documentation for  currencyinfo ), and an exponent representing the number of decimal points to describe the minor currency unit in terms of the major currency unit. Conventionally, the symbol used to describe custom currencies should consist of only lowercase letters.  btc = newcurrency!(:btc,  Bitcoin , 8)  # 1.00000000 BTC  source  #  Currencies.CurrenciesBase.shortsymbol     Function .  shortsymbol(s::Symbol)   \u2192 String\nshortsymbol(m::Monetary) \u2192 String\nshortsymbol(t::DataType) \u2192 String  Get a short, possibly ambiguous, commonly-used symbol for a currency. This function may be called with either a symbol, a  Monetary  type, or a  Monetary  object.  source  #  Currencies.CurrenciesBase.@usingcurrencies     Macro .  Export each given currency symbol into the current namespace. The individual unit exported will be a full unit of the currency specified, not the smallest possible unit. For instance,  @usingcurrencies EUR  will export  EUR , a currency unit worth 1\u20ac, not a currency unit worth 0.01\u20ac.  @usingcurrencies EUR, GBP, AUD\n7AUD  # 7.00 AUD  There is no sane unit for certain currencies like  XAU  or  XAG , so this macro does not work for those. Instead, define them manually:  const XAU = Monetary(:XAU; precision=4)  source  #  Currencies.CurrenciesBase.@usingcustomcurrency     Macro .  Add a new currency to the (global) currency list and assign a variable in the local namespace to that currency's unit. Provide three arguments: an identifier for the currency, a string description of the currency (following the conventions outlined in the documentation for  currencyinfo ), and an exponent representing the number of decimal points to describe the minor currency unit in terms of the major currency unit. Conventionally, the identifer used to describe custom currencies should consist of only lowercase letters.  @usingcustomcurrency btc  Bitcoin  8\n10btc  # 10.00000000 btc  source  #  Currencies.CurrenciesBase.filltype     Method .  filltype(typ) \u2192 typ  Fill in default type parameters to get a fully-specified concrete type from a partially-specified one.  source",
